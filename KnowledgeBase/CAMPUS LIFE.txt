CAMPUS LIFE  
We believe that although studying is a major part of your life here on campus there should 
be times to have fun and a cool head to reflect on good things and times of your life here on 
campus Outside the classroom there are a number of activities student s can engage  in 
Therefore  KNUST has made arrangements  so that your dedicated time for social life is also 
made very comfortable and full of enjoyment  
Students social life on the campus is organized by the Junior Common Room Committees 
which also act as  liaison between the student body and the Hall authorities in their Halls The 
Students Representative Council SRC whose executive is appointed from campus wide 
elections is responsible for the co ordination of the activities of the various Junior Com mon 
Room Committees  There are Faculty societies which provide extra curricula  activities for 
junior members of the particular Faculty
