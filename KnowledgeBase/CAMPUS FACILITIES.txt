CAMPUS FACILITIES 
Infrastructure and Non-Residential Facilities Living on campus connects you to the full range of opportunities that KNUST has to offer. This is one reason why nearly all undergraduate students and more than 50 percent of graduate students live in halls and hostels on campus. KNUST boasts of six traditional halls of residence. University, Unity, Africa, Queen Elizabeth II, Independence and Republic Halls of residence are all Mixed-Sex Halls. A number of Private Hostels are available around the campus and in Kumasi for students who, as a result of the limited facilities/rooms could not be admitted as resident students. Currently, about 60% of the total student population is non-resident. There are also Non-Resident Facilities on campus (located near Club 'B' and the Central Classroom Block) where non-resident students could take a rest between lectures and do their own private studies before they leave for their various homes and hostels.
