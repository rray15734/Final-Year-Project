OFFICE OF THE DEAN OF STUDENTS 
The office of the Dean of Students was formally established in 1997 to provide the needed necessary welfare support services for students during their period of study at KNUST. The office, over the years, has sought to fulfil its mission by assisting students to understand in both specific and general terms how the university operates both at the social and academic levels. This consequently enables us to understand regulations and procedures and ways to getting their needs met. 
The office had further provided opportunities for students to develop and enhance their leadership skills by involving them in decision making processes, supporting advocacy for students and providing and involving them in conflict resolution techniques. The office is organized into sections to help provide support to the student body of the university community. They comprise of the administration , Student Guidance and Counselling , International Student Affairs , Student Representative Council Affairs , Students Housing and Residence Life , Student Conduct and Discipline, Student Support Services and Financial Services
