Preamble
One cardinal goal of the 
University is to assist her 
students and staff to become 
more competent purposeful 
and ethical through a teaching 
and learning environment which respects the 
dignity of all
In addition to the main campus in Kumasi 
KNUST has an Institute of Distance Learning 
with centres in all regional capitals as well as in 
the national capital Accra
The information contained in this Student 
Guide and Code of Conduct handbook applies 
to all students enrolled at the University and 
was deemed accurate at the time of printing 
Any updates will be done at Universities 
website httpwww knustedugh until the 
next print
This document is also meant to generate 
positive behaviour from students and inhibit 
negative ones The University will do its part by 
ensuring that the right atmosphere is provided 
to promote academic and personal growth
The efforts of the University in providing 
a sound learning environment would be 
seriously undermined if students are found to 
be engaged in general acts of misconduct and 
or proscribed conducts that tend to bring the 
Universitys name down in disrepute  Should 
that occur the University is dutybound to apply to the culprits appropriate sanctions 
the severest form of which is dismissal or being handed over to be tried in the law courts of 
Ghana if such conduct is found in breach of 
the laws of Ghana or both The reputation 
and integrity of KNUST among institutions of 
higher learning and as a national asset is of 
utmost important to alumni management 
faculty and staff Therefore students should 
not seek refuge under national law to escape 
internal enquiry when they have not fully 
exhausted all internal avenues of redress 
provided the issues under consideration are 
not life threatening
KNUST is dedicated to assist students to 
acquire academic excellence and personal 
development We encourage and promote the 
uniqueness of each person However we also 
recognize the interdependence of all members 
of the KNUST Community
For the University to accomplish her goals 
it is most important that we maintain an 
environment in which all members of the 
community have the opportunity to develop 
spiritually intellectually socially emotionally 
and physically To meet these obligations the 
University seeks to provide an environment 
conducive to academic endeavours social 
growth and individual selfdiscipline for each 
student To ensure that this environment is 
maintained this guide and conduct system 
has been established This system is viewed by 
the University as the part of the educational 
experience which occurs when a students 
conduct interferes with the Universitys 
KNUST  1

A Brief History of the University
The University has undergone several name 
changes for historical reasons It started off 
as Kumasi College of T echnology then as 
Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and 
Technology followed by University of Science 
and Technology before finally reverting to 
Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and 
Technology
Kumasi College of T echnology was established 
by a Government Ordinance of the Gold 
Coast on 6th October 1951 It however opened 
officially on 22nd January 1952 with 200 T eacher 
Training students transferred from Achimota 
College to form the nucleus of the new College 
In October 1952 the School of Engineering and 
the Department of Commerce were established 
and the first students were admitted From 1952 
to 1955 the School of Engineering prepared 
students for professional qualifications only 
In 1955 the School embarked on courses 
leading to the University of London Bachelor 
of Engineering External Degree Examinations 
A Pharmacy Department was established in 
January 1953 with the transfer of the former 
School of Pharmacy from KorleBu Hospital 
Accra to the College The Department ran a 
twoyear comprehensive course in Pharmacy 
leading to the award of the Pharmacy Board 
Certificate A Department of Agriculture was 
opened also in 1953 to provide a number of ad hoc courses of varying duration from a 
few terms to three years for the Ministry of 
Agriculture A Department of General Studies 
was also instituted to prepare students for 
the Higher School Certificate Examinations 
in both Science and Arts subjects and to give instruction in such subjects as were requested 
by the Arts subjects and to give instruction in 
such subjects as were requested by the other 
departments
Once established the College began to grow 
and in 1957 the School of Architecture T own 
Planning and Building was inaugurated and 
its first students were admitted in January 
1958 for professional courses in Architecture 
T own Planning and Building As the College 
expanded it was decided to make the Kumasi 
College of T echnology a purely Science and 
T echnology Institution
In pursuit of this policy the T eacher Training 
College with the exception of the Art School 
was transferred in January 1958 to the 
Winneba Training College now the University 
of Education Winneba and in 1959 the 
Commerce Department was transferred to 
Achimota to form the nucleus of the present 
School of Administration of the University of 
Ghana Legon4  KNUST
Students Guide  Code of ConductAccession to University Status
In December 1960 the Government of Ghana 
appointed a University Commission to advise 
it on the future development of University 
Education in Ghana in connection with the 
proposal to transform the University College of 
Ghana and the Kumasi College of T echnology 
into an independent university
Following the report of the Commission which 
came out early 1961 the Government decided 
to establish two independent Universities in 
Kumasi and at Legon near Accra The Kumasi 
College of T echnology was thus transformed 
into a fullfledged University Kwame Nkrumah 
University of Science and T echnology by an 
Act of Parliament on 22nd August 1961 The 
Universitys name was changed to University of 
Science and T echnology after the Revolution of 
24th February 1966 However by another Act of 
Parliament Act 559 of 1998 the University has 
been renamed Kwame  Nkrumah University of 
Science and T echnology Kumasi The University 
started awarding her own degrees in June 
1964 All degree examinations are reviewed by 
external examiners and moderators to ensure 
that high academic standards are maintained
General Information
The University is situated approximately on a 
sixteen squarekilometre campus of undulating 
land and pleasant surroundings about seven 
kilometres away from the central business district of the city of Kumasi The campus 
presents a panorama of beautiful and modern 
buildings interspersed with verdant lawns 
and tropical flora which provide a cool and 
refreshing atmosphere congenial to academic 
studies It has within the short period of its 
existence become an important centre for the 
training of scientists and technologists not only 
for Ghana but also for other African countries 
as well as from other parts of the world
There are six traditional Halls of Residence and 
a number of hostels on the University campus 
The Halls of Residence are Queen Elizabeth 
II Unity Independence Republic University 
and Africa Three of the Halls of residence are mixed two for males only and one for females 
only These traditional Halls have offices each 
with its kitchen dining hall and separate junior 
and senior common rooms for students and 
senior members of the Hall The residents share 
communal bathrooms and toilets
The oncampus hostels are mixture of post 
graduate and undergraduate accommodation 
The largest of these is managed by the Ghana 
Universities Staff Superannuation Scheme 
GUSSS The Otumfuo OseiTutu II Hostel has 
been put up by the cumulative contribution of 
undergraduate students over the years
Medical students of Komfo Anokye Teaching 
Hospital live in Universityowned VALCO 
hostels There are also a number of privately
owned hostels both on campus and off campus 
in the surrounding townships

Students Guide  Code of ConductThe New KNUST
KNUST has since January 2005 transformed 
from its previous centralized system of 
administration into significantly decentralized 
one called the Collegiate system Under 
this system the various faculties have been 
condensed into six colleges
Since its inception the University has been 
administered on the Facultybased system 
This naturally led to a situation where new 
Faculties and Institutes were created to 
meet the evergrowing academic pursuits of 
students The resultant collection of Faculties 
largely hampered efficient administrative 
and academic operations as duplication of 
efforts and long administrative processes 
were rampant The need to deal with these 
complexities and harmonize the operation of 
the existing structures became apparent and 
unavoidable
This was more so with the everincreasing 
numbers in student population True to 
the vision to make KNUST the model for 
technological education in Africa and the then 
ViceChancellors commitment to academic 
excellence the Collegiate System came into 
being with the promulgation of new statutes 
on November 29 2004 to underpin these 
changes
On 5th April 2005 the Pioneering Provosts 
were inducted and invested into office at 
the Great Hall of the KNUST They were Prof 
Stephen Osei College of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources CANR Prof S O Asiama 
College of Architecture and Planning CAP 
Prof Dr Dr Daniel Buor College of Art and 
Social Sciences CASS Prof F WY  Momade 
College of EngineeringCoE Prof Kwame 
Sarpong College of Health Sciences CHS 
and Prof Aboagye Menyeh College of Science 
CoS
The Colleges are semiautonomous which 
means that they are given the power to largely run on their own without much dependence 
on the central administration for financial 
support The Provosts report directly to 
the ViceChancellor There is also a school 
of Graduate Studies headed by a Dean who 
coordinates and facilitates graduate programs 
of the colleges and reports directly to the Vice
Chancellor
A College Registrar Finance Officer and 
Librarian directly assist the Provosts in 
administration Under each Provost are the 
various Faculties Centres Institutes and 
Departments headed by Deans Directors and 
Heads
As both administrative and academic leaders 
Colleges the Provosts are to provide the 
needed leadership for the Colleges to guarantee 
efficient running of their establishments

accommodation capacity for about 448 
students However the present student 
population is approximately 2000 The hall 
welcomed its first students on 16th October 
1968Private Hostel Accommodation
The university is unable to guarantee all 
students accommodation Most students 
are therefore living in private sector housing 
hostels most of which are located outside 
the university campus A majority of these 
hostels are however within walking distances 
to the university campus
There is a wide range of private hostel 
accommodation for students of KNUST to 
consider in Kumasi These range from hostels 
with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities 
to flats those with the study bedrooms 
having their own private bathrooms and small 
kitchenettes Some of the hostels even have air 
conditioners and internet connectivity in the 
study bedrooms All of them are selfcatering
Kumasi is a fantastic city to live in and living 
in your own accommodation away from the 
university will afford you the best opportunity 
to experience the vibrant and diverse nature of the city However private hostel accommodation is not easy to find and costs are considerably high in Kumasi
More detailed information including the list 
of private hostels their locations facilities and 
services as well as rents are available at the

Article I Introduction
As KNUST is a community of scholars an environment conducive to learning is vital to the success 
of our students The ViceChancellor is the Academic and Administrative head of KNUST He acts 
directly or often through a designee such as the office of the Dean of Students or through the 
Legal Unit of the Registry or any ad hoc committee The ViceChancellor has jurisdiction over all 
violations of the Student Code of Conduct and Guide
A student who chooses to enrol at KNUST assumes the obligation for conduct that is compatible 
with the universitys mission as an educational institution While students have the privilege to enrol 
at the institution of their choice choosing to enrol at KNUST requires a student to become aware 
of and abide by the behavioural standards of the university Ignorance of accepted boundaries of 
student behaviour as contained in this Student Code of Conduct and Guide is not a basis for 
excusing inappropriate behaviour
KNUST is an educational community that aspires to be purposeful open just disciplined caring 
and celebrative This document and the work and practices of the Office of the Dean of Students 
and other offices of the university are tangible examples that illustrate commitment to these ideals 
The university approves this Student Code of Conduct and Guide The ViceChancellor as the chief 
disciplinary officer of the university acting through delegated personnel and or offices interprets 
and enforces the Student Code The Student Code provisions may be extended or amended to 
apply to new and unanticipated situations as they may arise
The university conduct process is not equivalent to and does not conform to criminal law 
processes The universitys process is designed in part to determine responsibility or lack thereof 
for violations of the Student Code onlynot guilt or innocence relative to criminal matters 
The university conduct process shall be largely informal in nature to provide substantial justice 
and it shall not be bound by strict formal rules of evidence or procedure In view of this any 
acts bordering on criminality or felony and therefore violating laws of Ghana rather than this 
code shall be handed immediately to the police to process the case through the courts of Ghana
The conduct of students in the educational community is a part of the teaching process and as such 
the focus of this code shall be educational This includes the possible use of suspension or expulsion 
as student conduct measures as they may prove to be invaluable tools in the educational process of 
the university community The student conduct system is not only concerned with the individual 
students welfare but also the welfare of the university community Any question about the student 
conduct processes rules or policies or any other concern not specifically covered by the Student 
Code should be directed to the Dean of Students
Enrolment in the university does not insulate students from their obligation to behave in a manner 
consistent with local byelaws or national laws Violation of such laws while on or off university KNUST  65

for violations of the law off campus At its discretion the university may inform local authority of 
potential misconduct Students need to constantly remind themselves that wherever they are 
they should not undertake any acts that will bring the universitys name into disrepute
While any violation of the Student Code is considered a serious matter certain violations are 
considered to be of especially grave These violations include but not limited to
i acts of academic dishonesty
ii  any acts that disrupt the functions of the university
iii any acts that threaten the health or safety of any member of the university 
community or any other person

Article V Conduct Policies 
and Procedures
A  Overarching Conduct Policies and Procedures
Violation of Laws of Ghana and University Conduct
1  University conduct proceedings may be instituted against a student charged with 
conduct that potentially violates both criminal laws of Ghana and this Student 
Code that is if both possible violations result from the same factual situation 
without regard to any pending civil or criminal litigation in court or criminal arrest 
and prosecution Proceedings under this Student Code may be carried out prior to 
simultaneously with or following civil or criminal proceedings at the discretion of 
the ViceChancellor Determinations made or sanctions imposed under this Student 
Code shall not be subject to change because criminal charges arising out of the same 
facts giving rise to violation of University rules were dismissed reduced or resolved 
in favour of or against the criminal law defendant Legal Counsel may participate in 
Student Conduct Appointments Conduct Board Hearings or Administrative Hearings 
in an advisory role only to his client to ensure fairness but does not dictate direct or 
influence the agenda for the proceedings
2  When National state or local authorities charge a student with a violation of law 
the University will not request or agree to special consideration for that individual 
because of his or her status as a student If the alleged offense is also the subject of a 
proceeding before the Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing under the Student 
Code however the University may advise off campus authorities of the existence of 
the Student Code and of how such matters may be handled internally within the 
University community
3  The University will cooperate fully with law enforcement and other agencies in the 
enforcement of criminal law on any University premises and with the conditions 
imposed by criminal courts for the rehabilitation of student violators

incident report against any student for possible violation of the Student Code Typically

Conduct Administrator and therefore responsible for the administration of the University KNUST  89
Students Guide  Code of Conductconduct system Any complaint should be submitted as soon as possible after the event 
takes place preferably within five days

the University Legal Office may conduct an investigation to determine if the complaints 
have merit and necessitate an appointment or hearing
6  Initial alleged violations of student conduct shall be presented to the respondent in 
written form Cases that could result in suspension or expulsion shall be heard no sooner 
than 24 hours after notice is given to the respondent

at that point decide whether or not to refer incidents to a KNUST Conduct Board an 
administrative hearing or simply conduct a student conduct appointment to determine 
responsibility and outcomes if any
8  When the Dean of Students and therefore Student Conduct Administrator on advice 
decides that an incident warrants the potential of a student being removed from housing 
suspended or expelled the student may or may not have the option to select if the 
hearing will be heard by a Conduct Board or Administratively
9  In cases of sexual misconduct or other behaviour where the participants safety is a 
concern the Student Conduct Administrator may alter conduct procedures to protect

after a rapid preliminary investigation and medical screening It shall also be referred 
to the police Rape is felony under the laws of Ghana

the right to offer evidence in defence In such case however the appointmenthearing 
will proceed as scheduled without the respondents participation Except in the case of a student charged with failing to set up or keep a student conduct appointment or hearing 
meeting no student may be found to have violated the Student Code solely because the 
student failed to appear In all cases the information in support of the student conduct 
violations shall be presented and considered
12  Witnesses or persons involved may be asked to meet with the Student Conduct 
Administrator and possibly appear before a conduct hearing board andor participate in a

organizations are encouraged and supported in the cultivation of social cultural intellectual

heard and they are empowered to becoming more competent purposeful and ethical members 
of KNUST community
However only registered organizations are allowed to congregate openly and use University facilities 
in the excess of 10 people Certificates for registered clubs are up for renewal yearly through the

that the association still exists These organizations provide programming collaboration and an 
opportunity for students to be involved in their college experience outside of academic classrooms 
Many organizations exist from academic religious and social types The Office of the Dean of 
Students works sidebyside with student leadership to bring new organizations to campus and 
assist in the registration process A wide range of programs and events are sponsored through KNUST  103

Appendices
Appendix A Privacy rights of students
KNUST provides that as far as possible the institution will maintain the confidentiality of details 
student education records establish the rights of students to inspect and review their education 
records and provide procedures for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through 
informal and formal hearings In compliance with this KNUST has formulated an institutional policy 
that accords all the rights under the policy to students who are declared independent Thus no one 
outside the institution shall have access to nor will the institution disclose any information from 
students educational records without the written request of the students except to personnel 
within the institution to officials of other institutions in which students seek to enrol to persons 
or organizations or individual guardians providing students financial aid to accrediting agencies 
carrying out their accreditation function to persons in compliance with a judicial order and to 
persons in an emergency in order to protect the health or safety of students or other persons All these exceptions are permitted under the policy
Within KNUST only those members designated as School Officials individually or collectively 
with legitimate educational interest in a students educational records are allowed access to the 
records A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative supervisory 
academic research or support staff position including law enforcement unit personnel and health 
staff a person or company with whom the University has contracted such as attorney auditor or 
collection agent a person serving on the University Council or a student on an official committee 
such a disciplinary or grievance committee or assisting another school official in performing his 
or her task
At her discretion KNUST may provide Directory Information in accordance with the provisions of 
the policy to include
Students Name address telephone number student email address date and place of birth major 
fields of study participation in officially recognized activities and sports weight and height of 
athletic team members photograph dates of attendance degrees and awards received most recent 
educational institution attended and other similar information as defined by the University which 
would not generally be considered harmful to the student or an invasion of privacy if disclosed
Students may withhold the above listed information by contacting the Office of the Registrar for 
more information concerning the release andor withholding of directory information
KNUST has established administrative procedures necessary to accomplish and ensure compliance 
with the policy specifically including procedures permitting students to inspect and review their 128  KNUST
Students Guide  Code of Conducteducational records and the opportunity for discussion or a hearing if a student challenges any 
materials in such records The Registrar is designated as the officer with responsibility for ensuring 
University compliance with this policy
Appendix B ParentalGuardian Notification
As a University KNUST believes that family plays an essential role in the educational process The 
University therefore will at its discretion inform parents or legal guardians of serious matters 
affecting the educational development of their dependent children at the University
Specifically it is the policy of KNUST to inform parentsguardians of students when they have been 
found responsible for violating institutional policies related to 1 drugs use peddling or possession 
2 falling foul of local byelaws or national laws andor 3 show a pattern of abuse in both drugs 
and alcohol Additionally KNUST will inform parentsguardians if the University is concerned 
about the personal safety or wellbeing of a student Exceptions will be made under extreme 
circumstances if the Dean of Students or his designeeDirector of Health Services or his designee
Head of Counselling or his designee determine that informing a parent would be dangerous to the 
wellbeing of the student
Appendix C Alcohol Policy
As an educational institution KNUST is committed to the development of a healthy environment 
which stimulates intellectual and personal development in students besides assuring their physical wellbeing During their collegiate years students will have the opportunity to grow develop and 
experience while continuing to respect themselves and others The University promotes respect 
for individual rights and privileges which from a historical perspective has included mature 
and responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages However individuals must realize that by 
exercising their rights they assume responsibilities This privilege enables the University to create a 
cocurricular atmosphere in which the responsible use of alcoholic beverages by those that are of 
legal age 21 years and choose to do so is accepted and respected In the context of this use each 
student is afforded the opportunity to clarify values related to alcohol consumption
All members of the University must understand that the institution neither encourages the 
use nor condones the misuse of alcohol In that regard no student facility shall be allowed to 
sell alcohol openly or otherwise However the institution does respect the privilege of choice for 
those of LEGAL AGE As members of the University community we must all encourage responsible 
drinking habits by individuals who choose to drink while we respect the rights of those who choose to abstain from alcohol use In following this policy we seek to create an atmosphere that 
promotes growth that could assist our students to become more competent purposeful and 
ethical Intoxication is never an acceptable excuse for misconduct or infringement upon the 
rights of others
Appendix D Drug Policy
KNUST does not condone the use of any illicit drug Therefore the possession consumption 
sharing or sale of marijuana narcotics illegal synthetic drugs non  prescribed prescription drugs KNUST  129
Students Guide  Code of Conductor other illegal drugs is prohibited Do also note it is illegal under the laws of Ghana Offenders 
shall be prosecuted
There are reasons other than legal implications that warrant the Universitys concern about drugs 
The availability of drugs in any large group setting subjects members to potentially serious security 
risks The potential for drug use will continue to attract nonmembers of the University community 
and are interested in drugs for reasons of personal profit
Student involvement in such matters is of concern to the University whether it occurs on or off  
the campus and irrespective of any action of civil authorities Involvement shall subject the student 
to disciplinary action
If illegal drugs are suspected in a residents room authorization for a search will be requested and 
granted from the head of security whose men shall lead the search Authorization may also be 
secured from the Dean of Students or his designee Hall and hostel staff may enter the room and 
conduct a search If illegal drugs are identified in the search the Ghana Police will be summoned 
to test the substance confiscate the substance if it is found to be illegal and issue citations when appropriate
KNUST reserves the right to confiscate illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia that are discovered in 
students rooms possessions or public areas of the campus If drugs or drug paraphernalia are found 
the incident will be documented All documented incidents of illegal drug use or possession shall be 
processed FIRST internally through the KNUST security and samples given to police for verification 
in the crime lab at cost to the University Disciplinary action shall then follow among other things 
the culprit shall be asked to refund for the cost of the test
KNUST Alcohol  Drugs Amnesty
In recognition of the KNUSTs primary concern for the health and safety of its community a Good 
Samaritan Policy is established to provide amnesty from infractions under the Universitys 
Student Code of Conduct for alcohol and drug use under certain circumstances The policy is 
intended to encourage students to seek assistance for themselves or someone else by reducing fear 
of facing disciplinary action under the Universitys Student Code of Conduct for alcohol andor drug use Further the Good Samaritan Policy attempts to remove barriers that prevent students from 
seeking the medical or law enforcement attention or other assistance that they need when sexual 
misconduct has occurred
However the Good Samaritan Policy does not necessarily grant amnesty for criminal civil or 
legal consequences for violations of national laws The local law enforcement authority has 
sworn police officers with full arrest authority and in some circumstances they have discretion 
to exercise that arrest authority as circumstances dictate according to their training and 
professional experience
Appendix E Freedom of Expression
KNUST assures its student body that the students viewpoint presented through proper channels 
will be listened to and given full consideration on all matters affecting the lives and welfare of students KNUST respects and upholds the rights of students to mass criticize object dissent 130  KNUST
Students Guide  Code of Conductprotest and demonstrate provided the necessary reliefs are sought and granted ahead of any 
such exhibition from the ViceChancellor through the Dean of Students  two weeks at the 
minimum
When permission is granted for any such mass activity it may well invite differences of opinion and 
conflicts of ideas which in extreme cases could result in actions that prove to be disruptive to the 
University or the civic community To guard against the possibility of such disruptive activity the 
University may restrict the time the location and the manner of the activity The University insists 
that student dissent in whatever form it takes must always show respect for
  other people University and public property and private property
  the rights and freedoms of others both individuals and groups
  the orderly functions of the University
  the moral and religious concepts on which the University is based
The University will exercise it full range of student conduct sanctions andor Ghana police resources 
against demonstrators who
  perform wilful acts of violence against persons or property
  abrogate or abridge the rights and freedoms of others
  disrupt the orderly functioning of the University
  act to subvert or undermine the moral or religious bases of human freedom
Appendix F Academic Dishonesty Policy
Academic Integrity
All members of the community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic 
endeavours Since violations of academic integrity erode community confidence and undermine 
the pursuit of truth and knowledge at KNUST academic dishonesty is therefore not acceptable  
The Office of each College Provosts has responsibility for the oversight and enforcement of the 
Academic Integrity Policy and for making the policy an institutional priority The Office of the 
Provost is also responsible for publishing the policy and for educating faculty staff and students 
about the policy Faculty members play a crucial role in implementing the Academic Integrity Policy 
They are responsible for educating their students about the importance of academic integrity and 
for communicating to students their expectations with respect to academic integrity in course 
work They also report alleged violations of the policy to the Provost
Students have the responsibility to know and understand the Academic Integrity Policy to comply 
with the policy in their academic work and to inform their lecturers andor the Department heads 
Deans or Provosts as the case may be if they are aware of violations of the Academic Integrity PolicyKNUST  131

Appendix J AIDS Policy
Should the need arise for dealing with employees or students with AIDS Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome the University has adopted this policy recognizing that AIDS is a serious 
illness a public health problem and an immediate concern to the University community AIDS 
is characterized by a defect in the natural immunity against disease People who have AIDS are 
vulnerable to critical illnesses which would not be a threat to anyone whose immune system was 
functioning normally
AIDS is caused by a virus commonly called HIV Presently there is no known cure or effective vaccine 
However the consensus of authoritative medical opinion is that AIDS is not a readily communicable 
disease There are no known cases of AIDS transmission by food water insects or casual contact 
socially or in the workplace and no spread of the virus has been found within family groups in which one or more persons have been diagnosed with AIDS The current scientific understanding 
is that the AIDS virus is transmitted only through an exchange of blood that occurs when a needle 
of an infected person in most cases a drug addict is used by someone else through a blood 
transfusion from an infected person or by intimate contact involving the transfer of semen and 
other bodily fluids Considering this current medical opinion there is no basis for routinely excluding 
or dismissing employees or students because they have AIDS ARC AIDSrelated complex or AIDS 
virus antibodies The University will make a decision on any person known to have a virus on a 
case  bycase basis with the help of medical advice Depending on the medical circumstances 
of each situation the University may regularly monitor or require the monitoring of the persons 
medical condition and may counsel the person on the nature of the disease and the importance 
of not engaging in behaviour which could transmit the disease if that is appropriate No broad 
bloodscreening test will be required The right to privacy of all individuals will be respected and 
protected and the confidentiality of any records that may be required will be maintained Because 
the virus is not transmitted by ordinary contact it is neither necessary nor appropriate for the protection of a roommate classmate or employee to share with them any information regarding a student or employee with an AIDSrelated condition Anyone with questions about AIDS may 
contact the Dean of Students in confidence or the Director of Health Services or the Head of KNUST 
Counselling centre Discrimination against a person who has AIDS or who is perceived to have or 
be at risk of having AIDS is a violation of national law Any employee or student who believes she 
has been a victim of AIDS discrimination may file a formal complaint at the Registrars office or at 
the office of the Dean of Students as the case may apply
Appendix K Fire Alarms  Equipment
Alarm boxes fire extinguishers fire hoses exit signs smoke detectors and heat sensors as well as 
other fire equipment are located throughout the campus If they are used for purposes other than 
fires they may not be available or functional when they are neededKNUST  137
Students Guide  Code of ConductIn newer buildings some corridor entrances are protected by a special door which in case of fire 
will help prevent the fire from spreading Propping these doors open destroys their effectiveness 
and jeopardizes the safety of all residents
To help provide for the safety of residents periodic fire drills are scheduled each semester students 
are required to vacate the building Fire drills and safety practices in the residence halls should be 
taken seriously because thoughtless behaviour may develop into a dangerous situation for everyone
Fire Regulations Fire alarms are installed in all buildings on campus When the alarm sounds 
everyone is expected to evacuate the buildings in a quiet orderly manner through the closest exit 
Fire escape plans are posted at each exit
Any student responsible for a false alarm may be subject to a GH 20000 false alarm fine and the 
possibility of additional disciplinary or legal action Tampering with fire equipment is prohibited 
and constitutes a breach of policy and may subject the students involved to disciplinary or legal action Students who assist in the apprehension of anyone tampering with equipment or pulling a false alarm may be eligible for a reward In case of fire notify the campus fire service security 
desks immediately

B  Definition of Affirmative Consent
AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT Affirmative consent hereafter consent is the voluntary 
unambiguous clear agreement in an act and understood by each party It is the responsibility 
of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that the person has the consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity Consent must be on going throughout a sexual 
activity and may be withdrawn at any time before the completion of an act A person may be 
incapable of consent due to physical or mental incapacitation physical or mental disability threat 
coercion the influence of alcohol or drugs being asleep or under the legal age of consent
What is not consent
	Consent to one act does not infer or imply that a person is consenting to another act148  KNUST
Students Guide  Code of Conduct	Consent to an act on a prior occasion does not infer or imply consent to a current act
	The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved or the fact of past 
sexual relations between them should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of 
consent
	An individuals silence or lack of protest does not infer or imply that they are consenting 
to an act
Consent must be clear and obvious by all partners who have willingly and affirmatively chosen 
to participate without force threat or coercion throughout the act
	Incapacitated individuals physically mentally andor due to alcohol or other drugs are 
unable to consent
	 For purposes of this Policy the standard that shall be applied is whether or not 
a reasonable person would have known based on the facts and circumstances 
presented that the other person was incapacitated and therefore not capable of 
giving consent
	 A respondent cannot claim that being under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a 
defence or excuse for engaging in sexual misconduct
	If at any time consent is uncertain the initiating party should stop and obtain verbal 
consent The use of any force coercion threat or intimidation negates consent It is 
important to note that in the evaluation of a complaint in a disciplinary process it 
shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant consented 
to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances
1  the accuseds belief in consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the 
accused or
2  the accused did not take reasonable steps in the circumstances known to the 
accused at the time to ascertain whether the complainant consented
Additionally it shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant 
consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that 
the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following 
circumstances
1  the complainant was asleep or unconscious
2  the complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs alcohol or 
medication so that the complainant could not understand the fact nature or extent 
of the sexual activity or
3  the complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition
KNUST will use the reasonable person standard in determining whether or not the respondent 
knew or should have known given all facts and circumstances present at the time if any of the 
above conditions were metKNUST  149
Students Guide  Code of ConductOther Definitions
Coercion
An expression through words or acts of threats intimidation or undue or unreasonable pressure

The person reporting sexual misconduct The Complainant can be either the victim or a third party
 Consensual Relationships
 Romantic andor sexual relationships between KNUST employees and students even with

should be avoided because they may negatively impact the learning environment
Moreover KNUST prohibits all employees from having romantic sexual or other close personal

emergency hospitalization or a court order While specific information may be kept confidential 
these incidents may be counted for statistical purposes The confidential resources shall include the 
University Chaplains and the professional staff of the KNUST Counselling Centre
Nonconfidential resources  are individuals who are required to deal with these cases and to 
report these incidents of alleged sexual misconduct The nonconfidential resources include the 
Dean of Students his Deputy the head of Security and his Deputy These will keep the identity 
of an unwilling victim or witness confidential However confidentiality cannot be guaranteed 
as they must balance a request for confidentiality against the safety of other members in 
our community If these determine that there is the threat of imminent or on going harm to 
an individual or to the community information may need to be shared and then only with 
appropriate individuals If the Complainant reports to the University and requests confidentiality KNUST  151
Students Guide  Code of Conductor asks that the report not be pursued the KNUST will take all reasonable steps to investigate and 
respond to the report consistent with the request for confidentiality or request not to pursue 
an investigation If a Complainant insists that hisher name or other identifiable information not 
be disclosed to the Respondent KNUSTs ability to respond may be limited If the Complainant 
continues to ask that his or her name not be revealed the University will take all reasonable steps 
to investigate and respond to the report consistent with the respondents request as long as doing 
so does not prevent the KNUST from responding effectively to the harassment and preventing 
harassment of other members of the community These officers plus any others included for 
their legal social and medical expertise will evaluate the confidentiality request in the context 
of its responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all persons If it 
is determined that circumstances do not allow a request for confidentiality to be granted the 
University will take action as appropriate It is a violation of KNUST policy to retaliate against an 
individual who reports sexual misconduct is a Complainant in an investigation serves as a witness 
or is a third party involved in the investigation of such a report
 Additionally personal identifiable information will be treated as confidential and only shared 
with persons who have a specific need to know and who are investigatingadjudicating the 
report or delivering resources or support services Further KNUST will maintain as confidential 
any accommodations or protective measures provided to the Complainant  to the extent 
that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the KNUSTs ability to provide such 
accommodations or protective measures

B Responsibility of KNUST Employees to Report
KNUST employee including faculty student and professional staff and administrators who learns 
of an incident of sexual misconduct MUST report it within 24 hours
C  Essentials of a Report
1  A report is made when the University knows or reasonably should know based on the 
statements of a complainant or a third party that sexual misconduct has occurred
2  A complainant need not supply a written statement although it is preferable
3  Actual notice which consists of direct statements from a complainant of sexual 
misconduct is desirable although the University accepts verbal or written statements 
from any party who has knowledge of an incident occurring either on or off campus that 
has the potential to interfere with the educational mission or associated activities of the 
University and thus bring its hard earned reputation into disrepute
4  KNUST reserves the right to bring reports forward against a student or staff and to act as 
the Complainant for purposes of this Policy In addition an individual does not have to be 
a member of the University to file a report under this Policy
D Medical Attention

victim should consider seeking medical attention as soon as possible at the closest emergency room
E Resources
Upon receipt of a report the University will inform the complainant of the availability of medical 
counselling and support services and additional interim measures to prevent contact between 
a complainant and a respondent such as housing academic transportation and working  
accommodations if reasonably availableKNUST  153
Students Guide  Code of ConductF Right to Pursue Criminal Charges
1 Notwithstanding what the University can or shall do the victim has the right to file an 
incident report with law enforcement agency
2 Although KNUST strongly encourages all members of its community to report violations 
of this Policy to law enforcement agency it is the victims choice whether to make such a 
report and victims have the right to decline involvement with the police The University 
will assist any victim with notifying local police if heshe so desires
3 A complainant may choose NOT to have law enforcement contacted and no report 
filed BUT still may have forensic evidence collected Note The Complainant later may 
choose to file a police report and cooperate with a criminal investigation Victims of 
sexual assault are encouraged to request and cooperate fully with an investigation so the 
possibility of filing criminal charges remains an option if they later chose to do so
4 If a survivor does not want to make a report to police heshe may seek civil remedies 
including the filing of an application for a restraining order For additional information 
about civil remedies the survivor should contact hisher own legal counsel
5 A complainant may file a police incident report and ask that the investigation and 
charges be pursued immediately While the prosecuting attorney is still the decision
maker in whether the perpetrator is charged criminally the complainant can cooperate 
and provide as much timely information as may be possible
Timing of Reporting
While KNUST does not limit the time in which a report can be made 
as time passes evidence may dissipate or become lost or unavailable 
thereby making investigation possible prosecution or obtaining pro
tection from protective orders related to the incident more difficult If 
a victim chooses not to make a report regarding an incident heshe 
nevertheless should consider speaking with local law enforcement to 
preserve evidence in the event that heshe changes herhis mind at a 
later time
Jurisdiction  Reporting Timeframes
Since sexual misconduct that occurs off campus may impact a persons work academic or co
curricular experience KNUST assumes jurisdiction to adjudicate off campus reports of sexual 
misconduct if the alleged misconduct was committed by a KNUST student In addition the 
University encourages prompt reporting of sexual misconduct so that the University can respond 
promptly and equitably however the University does not limit the timeframe for reporting
Interim andor Protective Measures

for a specified period of time Specifically students who have been suspended or expelled from 
the University may have their email account terminated immediately or directly after all appeal 
procedures have been exhausted
The Policy enforces nonretaliation
Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is taken against the person who has brought the 
report or assisted in a resulting investigation under this Policy It is important to note that 
impermissible retaliation can occur even in those circumstances where it is determined that 
the underlying report could not be substantiated Any allegations of retaliation will result in 
an immediate investigation and appropriate action consistent with the Universitys due process 
procedures Acts of retaliation may include but are not limited to
	Pressuring or enlisting the aid of third parties to have a complainant to withdraw the 
complaint
	Bullying harassment slutshaming or blackballing a participant in a complaint through 
social media or the internet
	Lowering a grade
	Stalking or threatening
	Removal from classes teams activities
	Employment actions such as termination demotion or change in schedule without 
cause
	Other actions affecting a persons employment or academic or schoolrelated activities 
such as threats unjustified negative evaluations unjustified negative references or 
increased surveillance and
	Any other action such as an assault or unfounded ie baseless or falsely reported civil or 
criminal charges that are likely to deter reasonable people from pursuing their rights
NOTE Adverse actions do not include petty slights and annoyances such as stray 
negative comments in an otherwise positive or neutral evaluation snubbing not talking to a student or negative comments that are justified by a student or 
employees poor academic or work performance or history
 It is unlawful and a violation of University policy to retaliate against any faculty staff 
member or student who has brought a goodfaith report of sexual misconduct or 
who has assisted in the investigation of a report of sexual misconduct Retaliation 
destroys the sense of community and trust that is critical to a learning and work 
environment The University considers acts of retaliation in response to such 
disclosures or participation to constitute a serious violation of policy which may 
result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal against the retaliator
This policy does not equate Incapacitation as Consent
Individuals who are incapacitated cannot consent to sexual activity Incapacitation renders an 
individual unable to understand the fact nature or extent of the sexual activity Incapacitation 158  KNUST
Students Guide  Code of Conductthat renders a person mentally or physically helpless may result from intoxication or substance 
use passing out or being asleep Consent is not present if someone is incapacitated by alcohol 
or drugs legal or illegal A person with a cognitive impairment such as a mental illness or a 
mental condition that renders the person incapable of understanding the nature of his or her 
conduct cannot consent to sexual activity
When incapacitation occurs because of alcohol or drug use some indicators of incapacitation may 
include but is not limited to
	Slurred speech
	Bloodshot or unfocused eyes
	Needing assistance to walkstand
	Vomiting
	Outrageous or unusual behaviour
	Concern expressed by others about the individual or
	Expressed memory loss or disorientation
An individual also may be in a state known as a blackout when she or he is incapacitated and 
likely will have no memory of the sexual activity but may still be walking and talking Therefore 
it is particularly important that people engaging in sexual activity know each persons level of intoxication or impairment before beginning sexual activity 
Risk Reduction
Sexual assault and sexual misconduct are never the fault of the victim With no intent to 
blame complainants and in recognizing that only abusers are responsible for the acts of abuse 
they perpetrate the following are some strategies to reduce ones risk of sexual assault or harassment
	Make sure you understand how to get and give consent Make sure all participants have 
given consent prior to engaging in sexual activity and throughout the sexual activity
	Be active in supporting a safe and respectful community If you see others engaging in 
disrespectful or inappropriate actions speak up and get involved or contact someone 
else to assist
	Practice being assertive about your boundaries Respect the boundaries of others
	Trust your instincts If you feel uneasy or sense something is wrong call for assistance
The following strategies may help
1 Be aware of your surroundings Knowing where you are and who is around you may help 
you find a way to get out of a bad situation
2 Avoid isolated areas It is more difficult to get help if no one is around
3 Walk with purpose Even if you dont know where you are going act like you do
4  repetitive 4 and 10 should be put together
5 Try not to load yourself down with packages or bags as this can make you appear more 
vulnerable
6 Make sure your cell phone is with you and charged and that you have moneyKNUST 159
Students Guide  Code of Conduct7 Dont allow yourself to be isolated with someone you dont trust or someone you dont 
know
8 Avoid putting music headphones in both ears so that you can be more aware of your 
surroundings especially if you are walking alone
9 When you go to a social gathering go with a group of friends Arrive together check 
in with each other throughout the evening and leave together Knowing where you are 
and who is around you may help you find a way out of a bad situation
10 Trust your instincts  If you feel unsafe in any situation go with your gut If you can see 
something suspicious contact campus security or some law enforcement immediately
11 Dont leave your drink unattended while talking dancing using the restroom or 
making a phone call If youve left your drink alone just get a new one
12 Dont accept drinks from people you dont know or trust If you choose to accept 
a drink go with the person to the bar to order it watch it being poured and carry it 
yourself At parties dont drink from the punch bowls or other large common open 
containers
13 Watch out for your friends and vice versa If a friend seems out of it is too intoxicated 
for the amount of alcohol theyve had or is acting out of character get him or her to a 
safe place immediately
14 If you suspect you or a friend has been drugged contact law enforcement 
immediately  Be explicit with doctors so they can give you the correct tests you will 
need a urine test and possibly others
15 If you need to get out of an uncomfortable or scary situation here are some things you 
can try
a Remember that being in this situation is not your fault You did not do anything 
wrong it is the person who is making you uncomfortable that is to blame
b Be true to yourself Dont feel obligated to do anything you dont want to do I dont 
want to is always a good enough reason Do what feels right to you and what you are 
comfortable with
c Have a code word with your friends or family so that if you dont feel comfortable 
you can call them and communicate your discomfort without the person you are with 
knowing Your friends or family can then come to get you or make up an excuse for you 
to leave
d Lie If you dont want to hurt the persons feelings it is better to lie and make up a reason 
to leave than to stay and be uncomfortable scared or worse Some excuses you could use 
are needing to take care of a friend or family member not feeling well having somewhere 
else that you need to be etc
16 Try to think of an escape route How would you try to get out of the room Where are 
the doors Windows Are there people around who might be able to help you Is there an 
emergency phone nearby
17 If you andor the other person have been drinking you can say that you would rather 
wait until you both have your full judgment160  KNUST

APPENDIX M Policy  Procedure for 
handling student emergencies
1 Introduction
The stress of University life and the normal developmental issues of late adolescence and early 
adulthood place some students under emotional and psychological pressure which if not properly 
handled can lead to undesired consequence with implication for the larger University community 
The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology KNUST has faced and continue 
to wrestle with various student issues It is for this reason that the University needs clear and 
functional guidelines for handling studentrelated issues
At the KNUST there are many outfits dedicated to students welfare aside the KNUST Counselling 
Centre KCC which primarily serves the emotional and psychological needs of students These 
include the underlisted
1	The Office of the Dean of Students
2	Student Affairs
3	Chaplaincies
4	KNUST Security Services
5	Students Representative Council SRC
6	University Hospital
7	Hall Tutors and Administrators
8	College Administrators and Lecturers
The main thesis of this protocol is that an all hands on deck approach must be the most viable 
option if the University is to be successful in combating and efficiently responding to the myriads 
of student needs challenges and crisis
Therefore the following lines of communication are suggested for the reporting and disclosure of 
the underlisted studentrelated issues
A Academic and financial issues
B Medical nonpsychological issues
C SuicideDeath issues
D Psychological socialbehavioural issues
E Counselling referralsWalkinsKNUST  161
Students Guide  Code of Conduct2 Lines of Communication
A ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL ISSUES
I REGISTRATION DEFERMENT CHANGE OF PROGRAMME AND WITHDRAWAL
The Student Guide contains clear guidelines on all of the above student needs  registration 
deferment change of programme and withdrawal All university offices and personnel whose 
services are implicated for a smooth facilitation of these student needs are entreated to familiarize 
themselves with the stipulations in the Student Guide These regulationsprocesses are not 
reiterated here in this protocol
	Regulations regarding Registration of courses are outlined in the Students Guide and 
Code of Conduct However if a regularfeepayingparallel student is not able to register 
due to financial challenges the student should report to the Head of Department HOD  
Finance Office  and the Dean of Students DOS  The DOS  communicates back to the 
Finance Office
If a student has a financial problem related or unrelated to registration the student reports to the 
DOS  who refers the student to the Student Affairs for necessary action
	The protocol on deferment of programme for any reason is clearly specified in of the 
Students Guide
	The protocol on issues pertaining to change of programme is captured in Page 58  of the 
Students Guide
	On Page 62  of the Students Guide the protocol on withdrawal issues is clearly outlined
However if the aforementioned academic and financial issues have any underlying psychosocial 
implications the KNUST Counselling Centre KCC is consulted through the respective College 
Counsellor  as illustrated in the diagram below
B MEDICAL NONPSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES
Similarly regulations and procedures for students concerning medical issues are clearly specified 
in Page 52  of the Students Guide
If the students medical condition has an emotional or psychological component then the medical 
personnel  consults andor refers the case to the Counselling Centre  for support Walkin cases at 
the KCC needing medical attention will be referred to the Tech Hospital  A follow up of such cases 
will be done by KCC 
C PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES
The KCC is committed to the emotional and psychological wellbeing of students Therefore all 
such cases are to be referred to the Centre However since there are many other university offices
personnel that interact and work with students it is important that the various officespersonnel 
have a clear guide on how to communicate with each other for effective and timely response
	In the case of a suicide attempt leading to death162  KNUST
Students Guide  Code of Conduct	Or a suicide attempt that DOES NOT lead to death but hospitalization in both cases the 
following line of communication is recommended
 In the case of a suicide attempt leading to death in the hall or hostel either on or off 
campus the witness or roommate should inform the Hall AssistantHostel Manager  The 
Hall Assistant  Hostel Manger  informs  the hall or hostel administrators  Depending on 
the nature of the case and what is needed the Hall Hostel administrator will inform the 
Office of the Dean of Students  the University Hospital  and the Security  simultaneously 
All things being equal the sequence of communication from the HallHostel  must 
be through the Office of the Dean of Students  This Office must be in the lead of all 
information management and reporting to outside bodies
 In the event of death information to the family or any disclosure to close relatives 
or significant others must be done through the Office of the Dean of Students  The 
Counselling Centre can be contacted to manage the crisis and handle the emotional and 
psychological needs of family and significant others as and when necessary
 If there is unsuccessful suicide attempt no death but hospitalization still the Office 
of the Dean of Students takes the lead role in reporting and disclosure But either 
the hospital or the DOS may inform the Counselling Centre for the follow up case 
management
The recommended protocol is diagrammed below
	When a student dies at the KNUST Hospital the hospital administrator  reports to the 
DOS  who informs the Students Affairs section The DOS  discloses to family or significant 
others The nature of the death occurrence may or may not call for counselling services
	In the case of the death of a parentguardian of a student again the suddenness of the 
occurrence and or the nature of death may require counselling before the disclosure 
to the student who in this case is considered a minor and might be more emotionally 
vulnerable Therefore the following line of communication is recommended
D PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIALBEHAVIOURAL ISSUES
 In the event of physical assault drug use romantic relationship issues conflicts between 
roommates and theft cases in the halls hostels on and off campus or lecture halls the 
victimwitness reports to the HallHostel authorities or lecturers  around
 If the issue is threatening the authorities will report to the DOS and the KNUST Security  
Services 
 If the issue is more emotional the authorities will consult and refer to the KCC 
 In the case of injuries as a result of the assault the authorities report to the KNUST 
Security Services University Hospital and the DOS
E COUNSELING REFERRALS
 STAFF
In the case of staff the HOD reports the issue to Human Resource Development HRD who will refer 
the staff to KCC  for assessment and recommendationKNUST  163
