Security services
KNUST has its own private security service.  Security personnel are located at various vantage points across campus all day and night to ensure the safety of all members of the University community. The mission of the KNUST Security Service is to maintain a safe and secure campus by providing quality policing.  To ensure maximum safety however, the University community also has a role to play.
